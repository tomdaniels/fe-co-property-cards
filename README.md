# fe-co-property-cards

This application was created using the React.js framework. Bootstrapped with
`create-react-app`

The Data Array provided was used to create the props for the shortlist card component which can later be replaced with an actual call to an API endpoint.

Property addresses are clickable to mimic the real Domain.com.au experience! 

## Getting Started

To view the application simply clone it onto your machine and run it with yarn!
```terminal
git clone https://github.com/tomdaniels/fe-co-property-cards
cd fe-co-property-cards/my-app
yarn start
```
